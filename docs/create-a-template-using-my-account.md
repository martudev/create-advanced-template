# Create a template using GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc

1.  Upload you're template to your github repository
2.  Copy the https link to clone it. eg: `https://github.com/react-templating/babel-webpack-javascript.git`. Its **important** that must be https and it haves .git at the end. It is also important that the repository is public, otherwise it cannot be cloned. At the moment we do not support private repositories, but in the future we do have it in mind.
3.  Create your app using **create-advanced-template** by running this code

        create-advanced-template [your-https-git-url]

4.  Happy life ðŸ˜‰
